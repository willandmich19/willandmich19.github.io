                    <p><span class="no-widow">Michelle and</span> William have known each other for almost 6 years now. They were first briefly introduced by their friend Shadi at their friend John Clemente's BBQ. It was another day going to the Scarborough Bluff's beach to play volleyball that was when they really got to know each other much better. Ever since that day, they had fallen in love and continued to do so. These past years also had been nothing but memorable moments between the two. Michelle's hate for animals and William's love for animals is what people can say, opposites do attract each other. While that is just one example, there are many things that they have opposites in and they believe this is what keeps their relationship strong and <span class="no-widow">going forward.</span></p>

They were never introduced but her face was clearly one to remember for when their paths crossed again, Michelle and Jamielyn recognized one another. Jamielyn at the time was attending Seneca at York with Michelle attending York University. They had run into one another on the Steeles West Bus heading home. To their surprise, they ended up working together at McDonalds with Jamielyn being her Manager, and Michelle having saved her life when money accidentally fell out landing under the counter. Michelle came to the rescue giving Jamielyn a PERFECT TILL when counted. It was definitely a friendship that was destined to last with the amount of times their paths <span class="no-widow">had crossed.</span></p>

However, it was their passion for Diablo 2 that made their friendship solid (They played till 3am with an 8am class in the morning).

William chose Adam as the ring/coin bearer because he is the first little kid that William saw growing up from a baby more often than other kids, plus he is also a <span class="no-widow"></span>little Paulo.</span></p>
